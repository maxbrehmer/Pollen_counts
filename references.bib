 abstract = {We present a new method for data-based selection of the bandwidth in kernel density estimation which has excellent properties. It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

abstract = {A suction trap has been made in which the spores entering a narrow orifice, directed into the wind, are impacted on a Vaseline-coated microscope slide moved across the orifice at 2 mm./hr. Estimates of spore content of the air can be made, with higher efficiency than by previous traps, at different times of day and thus be more closely correlated with variations in weather. Wind-tunnel tests with spores of Lycopodium clavatum showed maximal and minimal efficiencies of 93.8 and 62.4\% respectively, with a suction rate of 10.0 1./min., in the range of wind speeds from 1.5 to 9.3 m./sec.},
